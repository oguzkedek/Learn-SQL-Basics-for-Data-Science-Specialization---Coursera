Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table    = 10000 rows
ii. Business table    = 10000 rows
iii. Category table   = 10000 rows
iv. Checkin table     = 10000 rows
v. elite_years table  = 10000 rows
vi. friend table      = 10000 rows
vii. hours table      = 10000 rows
viii. photo table     = 10000 rows 
ix. review table      = 10000 rows 
x. tip table          = 10000 rows 
xi. user table        = 10000 rows
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business     = 10000 distinct records for 'id' (pk) 
ii. Hours       = 1562 distinct records for 'business_id' (fk)
iii. Category   = 2643 distinct records for 'business_id' (fk)
iv. Attribute   = 1115 distinct records for 'business_id' (fk)
v. Review       = 10000 distinct records for 'id' (pk) , 9581 distinct records for user_id(fk), 8090 distinct records for business_id(fk)
vi. Checkin     = 493 distinct records for 'business_id' (fk)
vii. Photo      = 10000 distinct records for 'id' (pk) , 6493 distinct records for 'business_id' (fk)
viii. Tip       = 3979 distinct records for 'business_id' (fk), 537 distinct records for 'user_id' (fk)
ix. User 	= 10000 distinct records for 'id' (pk) 
x. Friend 	= 11 distinct records for 'user_id' (fk)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 distinct records for 'user_id' (fk)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?


	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

 We cannot say that more reviews are correlated with more fans. For example, the 2nd person with the most comments, Sara has 50 fans, while Lisa has 159 fans. Similarly, there are inconsistencies, different criteria need to be examined.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.


	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Yes, Loblaws which belongs to the 2-3 stars class, is open for 14 hours daily from 8 to 22 every day, while Cabin Fever which belongs to the 4-5 stars class, operates from 16 to 2 on busy days and operates from 18 to 2 on other days. In addition, Halo Brewery, which is in a 4-5 star class, is closed on Mondays, works between 11-21 on weekends and works between 15-21 on other days.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
       
While the 2-3 star business has 10 reviews, the 4-5 star business Cabin Fever has 26 reviews and Halo Brewery has 15 reviews.As a result, we can say that the more liked restaurants have more comments.  
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

No, All 3 businesses are located in different locations.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT
       CASE
       WHEN stars>=4 THEN '4-5 Stars'
       WHEN (stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3) THEN '2-3 Stars'
       END AS rating,

     INNER JOIN category
     ON B.id=category.business_id

     INNER JOIN hours H
     ON B.id=H.business_id

WHERE city='Toronto'
      AND category = 'Food'
      AND rating IS NOT NULL

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.


		
i. Difference 1:	average review = Closed -- > 23.2
					 Open   -- > 31.76	
         	
         
ii. Difference 2:	average_stars = Closed -- > 3.52
         				Open   -- > 3.68
         		
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT is_open
    	,COUNT(DISTINCT (id)) AS count_is_open
	,ROUND(AVG(review_count),2) AS avg_review
	,SUM(review_count)
	,ROUND(AVG(stars),2) AS avg_stars

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	


i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
- Finding the most common category in each region and predicting the overall star rating for this category.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           

- The purpose of my work is to find the most popular category of each region and make suggestions accordingly. When I examined the states, I noticed that there were businesses from England, Scotland and Germany in the database. Since the majority of businesses are located in America, I divided the Americas into regions and found the category with the most comments in each region. According to the results of the study, it is not surprising that beer garden is the category with the most comments in Germany :) 
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+---------------+---------------+-------------------+-------------+
| territory     |     avg_stars | max(count_review) | category    |
+---------------+---------------+-------------------+-------------+
| Britain       |           3.5 |                44 | Restaurants |
| Canada        | 	   3.45	|               557 | Restaurants |
| Germany       |           3.0 |                50 | Beer Garden |
| USA_Midwest   |          3.75 |               202 | Restaurants |
| USA_Northeast |           4.0 |               939 | Food        |
| USA_South     |           4.5 |                33 | Automotive  |
| USA_West      |          3.53 |              1605 | Restaurants |
+---------------+---------------+-------------------+-------------+
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

SELECT CASE 
		WHEN STATE IN ('PA','C','NY','OH') THEN 'USA_Northeast'
		WHEN STATE IN ('OH','IL','WI') THEN 'USA_Midwest'
		WHEN STATE IN ('NC','SC') THEN 'USA_South'
		WHEN STATE IN ('AZ','NV') THEN 'USA_West'
		WHEN STATE IN ('ON','QC') THEN 'Canada'
		WHEN STATE IN ('EDH','MLN','ELN','WLN','HLD','FIF','ESX') THEN 'Britain'
		ELSE 'Germany'
		END AS territory
	,ROUND((avg_stars),2)
	,max(count_review)
	,category
FROM (
	SELECT STATE
		,category
		,avg(stars) AS avg_stars
		,sum(review_count) AS count_review
	FROM business B
	INNER JOIN category C ON B.id = C.business_id
	GROUP BY state,category) Q
GROUP BY territory
